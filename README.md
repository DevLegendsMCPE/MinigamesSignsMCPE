Are you running a minigames server but can't find a dev for all the plugins and you are stuck to do the work alone?        Well hopefully this will help. This plugin allows you to set up minigame servers withh spawn. This plugin supports         multiworld meaning that the signs are only interactive when transporting to a diffrent world. This plugin has many cool    features and get's you a 10x better expirience in opening a server! We recommend that you do not download as for we are    still working on some new features to this plugin, until those features are added this plugin will CRASH your server.      We ask that you wait for a more stable build
